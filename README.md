### About

The only reason I wrote this jQuery plugin is that other plugins suck. They are wide-spread, but outdated and buggy.

Advantages of jquery-ns-textarea-autogrow:

* Grows vertically, horizontally or both
* Correctly handles 2 or more spaces
* Copies css and font styles to shadow div
* Correctly handles long words on one line
* Doesn't flick on Enter
* Doesn't add more than one handler to textarea
* Handles scrollbar if any
* Supports tags, quotes, ampersands
